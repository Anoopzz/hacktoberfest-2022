solve this issue 

  Q)You are given an integer , you have to convert it into a string.
  
   If your code successfully converts  into a string  the code will print "Good job". Otherwise it will print "Wrong answer".
   
   Example-1.
   Input -100
   Output - Good Job 
   
   Example-2 
   Input -200
   Output -Wrong answer
   Reason - This is not a string
