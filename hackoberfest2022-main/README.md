# 📌 Videos 📽️:

- [Hacktoberfest Intro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mq_FIHdxmIk)
- [How to pull request [Overview]](https://youtu.be/DIj2q02gvKs)
- [Merge Conflict / comment](https://youtu.be/zOx5PJTY8CI)


# Important rules📚:

```py
'''
Always make more then 4 pull requests.
Lets say you have made only 4 pull request to different projects,
but one project is excluded from hackoctoberfest event then your pull request will not be counted and 
then you have remaining 3 valid pull requests if these projects is not excluded.
If you fail to make 4 pull requests then you can't get swags or t-shirts.
I will recommend you to make pull request to your own repo which is very very safest side for you..
keep in mind that repo has hacktoberfest topic..
